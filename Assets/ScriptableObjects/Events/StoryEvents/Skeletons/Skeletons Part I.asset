  flavorText: "As you walk along a beach, you hear an odd sound, almost like dragging.
    You get closer to the source of the sound and see an animated skeleton struggling
    to push a treasure chest along the shore, possibly to a ship? The skeleton notices
    you, but does not flee. Maybe it\u2019s exhausted. Or maybe the treasure is too
    important to risk losing. What do you do?"
