  flavorText: "While heading back to your ship, you see a familiar face. And several,
    similar faces. The skeleton you helped earlier is standing by the docks with
    its crewmates, waving you over. \u201CAh, friend! Fleshy friend! Please, we humbly
    request your help once more.\u201D The skeleton explains that they need to recover,
    or rather, uncover the body of their crewmate, who is buried in a local cemetery.
    Disturbing a grave carries a heavy stigma, but perhaps it\u2019s worth the risk.
    What do you do?"
