  flavorText: While sailing the seas, you spot something floating in the distance.
    As you draw closer to it, you realize that it is a broken piece of wood with
    a parrot sitting on top of it. The parrot has an injured wing and is squawking
    in distress, as there is a shark watching it intently, waiting for a quick meal.
    What do you do?
